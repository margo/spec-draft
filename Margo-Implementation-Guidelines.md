# Margo Website Review & Improvement Recommendations

## Executive Summary

The Margo website (margo.org) serves as the primary portal for the Linux Foundation's edge interoperability initiative for industrial automation. While the site effectively communicates the project's mission and showcases industry support, there are significant opportunities for improvement in navigation, content organization, user experience, and technical implementation.

## Current Website Structure Analysis

### Main Website (margo.org)
- **Primary Content**: Single-page design featuring industry testimonials and basic mission statement
- **Related Subdomains**: 
  - `specification.margo.org` - Technical specifications (pre-draft)
  - `operations.margo.org` - Operational documentation and governance

### Identified Pages and Sections
1. **Homepage** (margo.org) - Industry testimonials and basic overview
2. **Specification Site** (specification.margo.org) - Technical documentation
3. **Operations Site** (operations.margo.org) - Governance and membership information
4. **GitHub Repository** (github.com/margo) - Source code and development

## Critical Areas Requiring Improvement

### 1. **Website Navigation & Information Architecture**

#### Current Issues:
- **Fragmented User Experience**: Content scattered across multiple subdomains without clear navigation paths
- **Missing Primary Navigation**: Homepage lacks essential navigation menu
- **Poor Content Discoverability**: Users cannot easily find key information like membership details, technical documentation, or contact information

#### Recommendations:
- Implement unified navigation across all subdomains
- Create clear navigation hierarchy: About → Specifications → Membership → Resources → Contact
- Add breadcrumb navigation for multi-level content
- Implement search functionality across all Margo properties

### 2. **Content Organization & Structure**

#### Current Issues:
- **Testimonial-Heavy Homepage**: Over-reliance on industry quotes without balanced informational content
