## Mission and Vision Context

### Margo's Mission

Margo's mission emphasizes unlocking innovation barriers in industrial automation through edge interoperability. This is achieved through creation of a reference implementation, open standard, and compliance testing toolkit to facilitate the interoperable orchestration of edge applications and devices.

The Margo initiative aims to accelerate digital transformation by simplifying the deployment, scalability, and operation of industrial solutions, thereby enabling organizations to innovate and grow more efficiently.

### Addressing Industrial Edge Pain Points

Recent trends in industrial manufacturing have created lifecycle management challenges due to the massive increase of compute devices and applications from multiple suppliers deployed in plants. Key challenges include:

- **Device Proliferation**: Manufacturing plants now deploy hundreds or thousands of edge computing devices from various vendors
- **Application Complexity**: Each device may run multiple containerized applications with different lifecycle requirements
- **Multi-Vendor Environment**: Lack of standardization creates integration challenges across vendor ecosystems
- **Operational Overhead**: Manual management of diverse devices and applications becomes unsustainable at scale

Margo addresses these challenges by providing a standardized approach to device management, application packaging, and workload orchestration that works across vendor boundaries.

### Open Approach Philosophy

Margo addresses innovation barriers through widespread collaboration and interaction with peer communities. The initiative embraces open standards and community-driven development to ensure broad adoption and interoperability. This approach includes:

- **Community-Driven Development**: Specifications evolve through input from device manufacturers, software vendors, and end users
- **Open Source Reference Implementation**: Provides concrete examples of how to implement the specification
- **Vendor-Neutral Standards**: Ensures no single vendor controls the specification's direction
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Designed to work with existing industrial automation systems and standards

### Linux Foundation Hosting

Margo is hosted by the Linux Foundation, ensuring:
- **Neutral Governance**: Independent oversight and community governance
- **Legal Framework**: Proper intellectual property and contribution policies
- **Community Infrastructure**: Meeting coordination, documentation hosting, and collaboration tools
- **Standards Development**: Alignment with industry best practices for open standard development

### Interoperability Goals

The three main goals of Margo's application description model enable workload fleet managers to:

**Display Workload Information**: Present comprehensive application catalogs with metadata, descriptions, and deployment requirements that help users make informed decisions about which applications to deploy.

**Determine Device Compatibility**: Automatically match workloads with compatible edge devices based on processor architecture, available resources, required capabilities (GPU presence, special hardware), and supported container runtimes.

**Capture Configuration Information**: Provide user-friendly interfaces for specifying application parameters during deployment and updates, with built-in validation to prevent configuration errors.

### Device Architecture Philosophy

Margo devices consist of three conceptual layers that provide clear separation of concerns:

```

**Margo Interface Layer**: Hosts the Margo management interface client that communicates with workload orchestration solutions. This layer handles device registration, capability reporting, desired state monitoring, and deployment status reporting.

**Platform Layer**: Contains the container runtime and orchestration platform (Kubernetes, Docker, Podman). This layer provides the execution environment for containerized workloads and abstracts underlying hardware differences.

**Traditional Device Layer**: Encompasses the hardware platform and base operating system. This layer provides compute, storage, networking, and any specialized industrial hardware interfaces.

### Device Role Architecture

Margo supports multiple device roles to accommodate different deployment scenarios:

**Supported Device Roles**:
- **Standalone Cluster**: Devices that operate as independent cluster functionality
- **Cluster Leader**: Devices that provide leadership role in a multi-device cluster configuration
- **Cluster Worker**: Devices that operate as worker nodes in a multi-device cluster
- **Standalone Device**: Devices that operate independently with single-device functionality

**Role Evolution**: Additional device roles will be introduced as the specification matures to support evolving industrial edge requirements.

**Implementation Flexibility**: Device vendors have freedom of implementation regarding specific components (e.g., OCI container runtime), as long as the component provides the agreed upon functionality that Application Vendors expect.

### Deployment Profile Strategy

**Multi-Profile Approach**: Applications should define deployment profiles for both Helm charts AND Compose components to maximize compatibility across different edge device types, even when one deployment method cannot be implemented.

**Benefits of Multi-Profile Design**:
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Single source of truth for application metadata and configuration
- **Consistent User Experience**: Users see one application that works across their device fleet
- **Efficient Distribution**: Reduced storage and bandwidth requirements compared to separate packages
- **Version Management**: Simplified version control and update processes

**Implementation Flexibility**: If either deployment profile cannot be implemented, it MAY be omitted, but Margo RECOMMENDS defining both profiles to strengthen interoperability and applicability.
